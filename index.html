                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>Based in Los Angeles, California, I started my journey into UX while working at a company during its transition to mobile-friendly design. I took an interest in finding ways to make our backend systems more user-friendly for my team and found joy in making things intuitive and efficient. I saw a problem that seems to recur often in the tech world: MVPs often overlook the user having a lovely experience which can lead to hardship for the user and expensive redesigns.</p>

                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>My experience working on teams, as a teacher, as a leader, and in customer service has shaped me to be receptive to people's needs and I want to bring that into the digital space. After completing a course in User Experience Design at General Assembly, a Coding Course with Skillcrush, and various projects to hone my skills, I’ve made a full switch to UX, where I can use my people skills and research driven mindset to create a lovely user experience.</p>

                        <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
                        <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

                        <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
                        <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>

                        <h3>Ease Converting Designs into Code</h3>
                        <p>You can trust me to take a designer’s PSD and quickly & accurately convert it into a webpage that is pixel-perfect match.</p>
